# A Brief Intro

```
    print('Hello World!)
```

It's a clich√© for an Indian to be an engineer. 

And that's exactly what I am.

The purpose of this blog (series) is to put down some chaotic thoughts -- the stuff that I won't talk to any human about -- in a semi-organized and **anonymous** way. I aim to *reflect* on my life and career as it unfolds. 

I also recognize the position of incredible privilege I write this from and try my best to distill insights from my experiences. 


# Who am I?

There are three kinds of desis: 
1. The raised in the motherland (**first-gens**)
2. The born + raised outside the motherland (**second-gens**)
3. Born in the motherland then raised outside the motherland (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_generations))

This is list is not comprehensive. I know foreign born Indians who have moved back to India at pre-college ages. I also know people of Indian origin who maintain their flavor Indian culture in a microcosm while having never visited India. I am a desi if the third kind. 

*Why Am I Confused?*&emsp; Being born in India before being replanted into a Western country, I was *just* Indian enough to learn and speak an Indian language fluently, and not too young to grow up entirely in the West. My parents ensured that the essence of Indian culture flavored my life, while the people around me in both life and school didn't share my off-white skin tone.

My group of melanin-challenged friends meant that I grew up in a mostly white setting with only the occasional cultural or religious excursion. For the most part, I was left to my own devices as my parents were often too busy to get involved in my life. They were happy to leave me be as long as I didn't cause too much trouble, got decent grades and stuck to a healthy roster of music, martial arts and sport. 

At the age of 14, both puberty and life hit me.

It also turns out that I was smart in school. Smart enough to get my parents for my parents to have *expectations* of me. While sometimes stressful, I enjoyed this new phase of life and big-brained my way into college to study Computer Science. I enjoyed university and the nascent field of machine learning so much that I stayed to do a PhD. My parents were well on board wth my plans after I assured them I had no interest of making a career in academia. 


## Fitting In

My university is *very* international. This gave me the chance to, for the first time in my life, potentially make friends of people with raised melanin counts. The people I met were either first-gens or second-gens, and I realized that I didn't fit in with either of them. 

**First-gen** humor was wildly different to mine. Conversations flowed really after the alcohol did and, for the most part, I felt I wasn't Indian enough for them to really consider hanging out with me in sober situations. 

**Second-gens** seemed far more comfortable with themseles. They had grown up with other second-gen friends and enjoyed more frequent and deeper exchanges in both the local and Indian cultures. They had learned how to balance being Indian without the awkwardness I often felt being Indian among friends. They were far more comfortable with the hyphenated 'X-Indian' identity and appreciative of the desi-ness of other second-gens, built by attending cultural and religious events with people of similar age. 

My limited involvement with/in Indian groups meant I never made those connections. My Indian-ness had always been a source of novelty to my friends and I was far less comfortable being both Indian with white people and white with Indians. 

Socially, at college, I defaulted back to what I was comfortable with. Just as at school, my closest friends lacked melanin. 


## What Am I?

My gen-ness falls somewhere [between 1 and 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_generations), and will probably be rounded to 2 if looking for an integer. Underlying this is my relative discomfort with being Indian in public -- my Indianness has always been private and limited to my family. My lack of Indian-social-interaction meant that I grew up thinking I was an introvert. 

I realize now that I was just uncomfortable being Indian and recognizing this has made me more look more carefully at myself when presented the opportunity to engage with other Indians. 


# Where is this Going?

I am in the final stretch of my PhD. It turns out I needed the PhD. I needed it not just as a launchpad into a (non-academic) career, but also to figure out who I am. 

I am grateful to my parents for what they gave me growing up. Limited Indian connections have given me a perspective on life distinct from both other groups. 

That's it for this post.
