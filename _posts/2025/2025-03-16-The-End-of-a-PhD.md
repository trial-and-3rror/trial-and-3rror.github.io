I defended recently. This post is a snapshot of my thoughts in the aftermath of the defence. 

Every PhD is different, as is the person doing one, and the resulting experience of each will vary. My views are based on my unique research program and psychological makeup and any reflections and views are highly biased to this.


## Looking Back

I think doing a PhD was right for me.

Internships during undergrad did not interest me. I dreaded the thought of returning to any of the fields I interned in, not because the workplace was horrible, but because I found other work more interesting, namely the kind of work that typically went to PhD's or exceptionally lucky non-PhDs. Often, for the non-PhD, this meant taking an iterative path of doing something less interesting and transitioning into the *fun* role over time. I had neither the patience nor the interest in taking this path. 

My experience working on my undergrad thesis project was tremendously fun and cemented my interest pursuing a PhD. The goal was still industry, but to go to industry as a specialist, directly into a specialist role. The PhD suited my temperament and looking back at four years of the program, I have learned a tremendous amount and have had the time to absorb and appreciate some of the concepts learned during undergrad more holistically.

So, going into the program, the post-PhD goal was always to to industry with no intention of an academic/postdoc life. I'm happy to say that this is one constant throughout my PhD experience - I never once was under the delusion that academic life was for me. Frankly, the industry compensation for machine learning PhDs was too damn tempting. 

During the PhD, I learned much about myself, and how to do research. I had the opportunity and directive to dive deep into something that interested me, and then solve it. 


## Kinds of PhD Applicants

Getting to know my PhD cohort, I quickly found that there were three kinds of candidates: 

1. Those for whom a PhD had been a long (> 1 year) plan. These people often had much more substantial research experience [(think UROPs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_Research_Opportunities_Program), and had a clear idea of what to research. 
2. Those who returned to academia after an industry stint. Industry gave these people perspective on what they wanted to do and why they wanted to return to academia. 
3. Those who decided to do a PhD on a whim. 

The first two categories comprised ~90% of my cohort with an even split. 

Why does this matter? 

Because it leads to my next point of discussion: deciding on a research topic. 


## Choosing a Research Area

Almost everyone I knew who had planned a PhD, had a reasonably clear research vision and their final thesis was close to their initial proposal. 

I was one of the last-minute deciders, and it showed in my PhD journey. My research proposal was in  a mostly statistics-focused area. By the time of enrolling, I had switched to a topic in machine learning. 

Over time, I found my interests changing and at the 2/2.5 year mark, I completely switched research areas. Beginning from scratch on a new topic meant that I spent the next year working at a breakneck pace to ensure that I had enough for a thesis before money and patience ran dry. 

I enjoyed that final year of my PhD tremendously. 

Only the projects I worked on during this final year made it into my thesis. 

The one thought that goes through my mind is whether with a little more research experience during undergrad, could I have selected my research area sooner? 


## The Importance of Advisor and Lab

The advisor and lab can make or break a PhD. Generally, most PhD candidates have research interests aligned with their advisors and labmates. My initial research proposal had a good overlap in this regard. 

As my research interests changed, I found myself an outlier: neither by advisor nor my labmates were doing anything in this area. In fact, while there were some academics in my department with interests in my field at a high level, no one was working in my exact area. 

This made my PhD experience quite lonely. A project lifecycle consisted of me and me alone taking an idea from conception to paper. My advisor's role was largely relegated to proof-reading manuscripts and approving travel budgets -- both of which I am grateful for, especially as [top ML conferences](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence) are often in expensive locations. 

While solitude meant that I was the first author on all my papers, the limited bandwidth I had meant that once a project was complete, I rarely looked at expanding on the work. In pursuit of novelty, all my papers were novel concepts (ergo, able to stand as sole thesis chapters) and rarely did I even think to revisit/extend the work to new fields. 

The key point I want to make here is that my experience is anomalous. It is preferable in academia to be collaborative and work extensively with peers. I was extremely fortunate to have a supportive advisor who was happy to let me research what I wanted and maintain financial support. The [PhD subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/) has (too) many posts of people in a similar situation to mine, without a supportive advisor, who can barely fathom completing their degree. 


## Am I Happy with my PhD?

I don't think any PhD is happy with their PhD. 

While writing my thesis, I had the chance to look back at the constituent papers and found flaws in each one. Flaws that not even [Reviewer 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/gqzpax/how_did_the_myth_of_reviewer_2_come_to_be/) found, and I often asked myself whether the work I had done was [PhD-worthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1i8jpl1/does_anyone_else_worry_their_work_isnt_novel/). 

The PhD journey is not an account of perfect research, but a record of the journey to becoming a good researcher. While my work is imperfect, chronological inspection shows that each project improves on the last one. 

I find myself applying my philosophy about martial arts to my degree:

    The goal is to be better today than I was yesterday.


## Final Thoughts

A PhD is a commitment. It is several years you dedicate to becoming an expert on one specific topic. Measuring PhD success is hard and when focused on critcising yourself, it is easy to lose track of what you have achieved. 

For anyone even considering a PhD, try and get substantial research experience beforehand, if at least to figure out what your research topic will be with high confidence. 

Once you've decided on a research area, find a *good* advisor who will have time for **you**, support your work, and leads a lab with overlapping interests and a collaborative culture.

I decided to do a PhD with a clear idea of how it would fit into my life and career. At no point did I consider a PhD as a way to escape or delay the real world. Anyone considering a PhD should have a **clear and pragmatic** idea of what they want out of the program and what they intend to do afterwards. 

And last of all, be fucking tenacious.
