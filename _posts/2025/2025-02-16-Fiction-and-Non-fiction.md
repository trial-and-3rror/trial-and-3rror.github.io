A pattern I have noticed in the course of the past few years: whenever I am doing active research (idea finding/experimenting and actively reading papers), I don't read non-fiction books. 

It's important to emphasize that I love reading. I routinely maxed out the book limit on both my own library card and my mother's card. Even through school and undergrad, I found time to read consistently. Almost always reading non-fiction books along with the occasional science book. This changed completely during my PhD. 

My fiction reading time is correlated with how my research is going. The sheer amount of stuff I have to read for research and I find that I tend to read fiction again only in the latter stages of a project -- when I am finishing up experiments and writing a paper and before I move on to my next topic. 

Christmas is a magical time. Everything goes quiet. The season also often coincides with the end of a project, and so I find my reading-for-pleasure time spikes every holiday season. 

I came across [this](https://jessica-seymour.com/2021/05/20/i-cant-read-for-pleasure-anymore/) blog by Jessica Seymour which describes how I felt when reading during *active research* periods. Maybe it is depression. I always enjoyed the reading demands of a PhD and the flavor of stress that accompanied my projects. Feeling stressed never made me feel bad and my outlet for stress was usually training harder. 

This is a weird post on a weird topic. Just trying to figure out which personal trends are indicators of underlying stress.
